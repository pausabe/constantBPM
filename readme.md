This project is about an app capable of track the current heart rate and show to the user if is lower or above a target value.
The target is configurable and the user will see displayed by a color it's doing it right.

The idea behind this app is to help people like me that only care about BPM while exercising.

For this project I decided to learn about SwiftUI and see how it works developing an Apple Watch app. 
Also, the pattern used to organize all the code is MVVM to help grow the project in a clear direction.
